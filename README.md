# Ecommerce website builed on MERN stack

This is my old project I have build for final-project in my University.

## Chungstore

Below is list function I have in my app:

- Create, Read, Update, Delete not only product, but also user, category and brand.
- Searching, filter all the product by category, price average, start review
- Order and Payment by Paypal
- Responsive with a lot of device
- List product with pagination
- Security when login
- Dashboard observe infomation of the store.
- Loading spinner to upgrade user experience
- Checking order and Order History
### Tool and Technology
- I try to apply MERN stack in this web with:
    - MongoDB to store database.
    - React to build the frontend.
    - Node, Express to upgrade the backend.
    - CSS and SCSS to build up the responsive.
    - Cloudiary to store image.
    - Several library for frontend like AntDesign, Material UI,..
    - JWT for authentication.
### Disadvantaged of this app.
- This app is build long time ago and I do not upgrade it so it use the old style of coding,
old version of React in Frontend, so make sure that if use try to use it, you should update
the way you use this code, just read the flow, the function, so you can understand and appy
the new version of React to make this app more beautiful and cleaner.
